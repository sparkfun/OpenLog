 OpenLog is based on the work of Bill Greiman and sdfatlib: http://code.google.com/p/sdfatlib/
 
 OpenLog is a simple serial logger based on the ATmega328 running at 16MHz. The ATmega328
 is able to talk to high capacity (larger than 2GB) SD cards. The whole purpose of this
 logger was to create a logger that just powered up and worked. OpenLog ships with an Arduino/Optiboot 
 115200bps serial bootloader running at 16MHz so you can load new firmware with a simple serial
 connection.
 
 OpenLog automatically works with 512MB, 1GB, 2GB, 4GB, 8GB, and 16GB microSD cards. We recommend FAT16 for 2GB and smaller cards. We
 recommend FAT32 for 4GB and larger cards.
 	
 OpenLog runs at 9600bps by default. This is configurable to 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200bps. You can alter 
 all settings including baud rate and escape characters by editing config.txt found on OpenLog.
 
 Type '?' to get a list of supported commands.
 	
 During power up, you will see '12<'. '1' indicates the serial connection is established. '2' indicates
 the SD card has been successfully initialized. '<' indicates OpenLog is ready to receive serial characters.
 
 Recording constant 115200bps datastreams are supported. Throw it everything you've got! To acheive this maximum record rate, please use the
 SD card formatter from : http://www.sdcard.org/consumers/formatter/. The fewer files on the card, the faster OpenLog is able to begin logging.
 200 files is ok. 2GB worth of music and pictures is not.
 	
 To a lower dir, use 'cd ..' instead of 'cd..'.
 	
 Only standard 8.3 file names are supported. "12345678.123" is acceptable. "123456789.123" is not.
 
 All file names are pushed to upper case. "NewLog.txt" will become "NEWLOG.TXT".
 
 Type 'set' to enter baud rate configuration menu. Select the baud rate and press enter. You will then 
 see a message 'Going to 9600bps...' or some such message. You will need to power down OpenLog, change 
 your system UART settings to match the new OpenLog baud rate and then power OpenLog back up.
 
 If you get OpenLog stuck into an unknown baudrate, there is a safety mechanism built-in. Tie the RX pin 
 to ground and power up OpenLog. You should see the LEDs blink back and forth for 2 seconds, then blink 
 in unison. Now power down OpenLog and remove the RX/GND jumper. OpenLog is now reset to 9600bps.
 	
 Please note: The preloaded Optiboot serial bootloader is 0.5k, and begins at 0x7E00 (32,256). If the code is
 larger than 32,256 bytes, you will get verification errors during serial bootloading.
 
 STAT1 LED is sitting on PD5 (Arduino D5) - toggles when character is received
 STAT2 LED is sitting on PB5 (Arduino D13) - toggles when SPI writes happen
 
 LED Flashing errors @ 2Hz:
 No SD card - 3 blinks
 Baud rate change (requires power cycle) - 4 blinks
 
 OpenLog regularly shuts down to conserve power. If after 0.5 seconds no characters are received, OpenLog will record any unsaved characters
 and go to sleep. OpenLog will automatically wake up and continue logging the instant a new character is received.
 
 1.55mA idle
 15mA actively writing
 
 Input voltage on VCC can be 3.3 to 12V. Input voltage on RX-I pin must not exceed 6V. Output voltage on
 TX-O pin will not be greater than 3.3V. This may cause problems with some systems - for example if your
 attached microcontroller requires 4V minimum for serial communication (this is rare).
 
 OpenLog has progressed significantly over the past three years. Please see Changes.txt or GitHub for a full change log.
 
 
 v3.0 Re-write of core functions. Support under Arduino v1.0. Now supports full speed 57600 and 115200bps! Lower standby power.
 
 28354 bytes out of 32256.
 
 Be sure to check out https://github.com/nseidle/OpenLog/issues for issues that have been resolved up to this version.
 
 Update to new beta version of SerialPort lib from Bill Greiman. Update to Arduino v1.0. With Bill's library, we don't need to hack the HardwareSerial.cpp.
 Re-wrote the append function. This function is the most important function and has the most affect on record accuracy. We are 
 now able to record at 57600 and 115200bps at full blast! The performance is vastly improved.
 
 To compile v3.0 you will need Arduino v1.0 and Bill's beta library: http://beta-lib.googlecode.com/files/SerialLoggerBeta20120108.zip
 Unzip 'SerialPortBeta20120106.zip' and 'SdFatBeta20120108.zip' to the libraries directory and close and restart Arduino.
 
 Small stuff:
 Redirected all static strings to point to the new way in Arduino 1.0: NewSerial.print(F("asdf")); instead of PgmPrint
 Figured out lower standby power from the low-power tutorial: http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/309
 Corrected #define TRUE to built-in supported 'true'
 Re-arranged some functions
 Migrating to Uno bootloader to get an additional 1500 bytes of program space
 Replumbed everything to get away from hardware UART
 Reduced # of sub directory support from 15 levels to 2 to allow for more RAM
 
 Wildcard remove is not yet supported in v3.0
 Wildcard ls is not yet supported in v3.0
 efcount and efinfo is not yet supported in v3.0
 
 Testing at 115200. First test with clean/empty card. The second test is with 193MB across 172 files on the microSD card.
 1GB: 333075/333075, 333075/333075
 8GB: 333075/333075, 333075/333075
 16GB: 333075/333075, 333075/333075
 The card with tons of files may have problems. Whenever possible, use a clean, empty, freshly formatted card.

 v3.1
 
 Added fix from issue 76: https://github.com/nseidle/OpenLog/issues/76
 Added support for verbose and echo settings recorded to the config file and EEPROM.
 

 v3 Light
 
 This version has the command line interface stripped out in order to simplify the overall program and increase the receive buffer (RAM).
